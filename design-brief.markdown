# [lisafeather.com] Design Brief

## A brief summary of the business / site goals.
*What problems are you trying to solve? What is the purpose of the app? (2-3 sentences)*

It's an artist web site with over 250 images that fall roughly into several categories. It's meant to be a catalog of the artist's entire body of work as well as showcase new pieces.

## The key users.
*Describe behaviors, expectation, knowledge, or other characteristics. (One sentence each)*

- Showcase artwork, so minimalist design and color elements with a lot of whitespace so the emphasis is on the art
- Easy to navigate for older, non-tech savvy crowd who collects art
- Elegant & intuitive viewing on all devices, particularly iPads 

## Scenarios in which your app or site will be used.
*These should be short narratives of the above users with your app / site. (One sentence each)*

- Site is usually referred to by people who have seen the artist's work somewhere and want to learn more
- Site wants to feel like a coffee table book, gives a sense of comfort and says "come in, relax, look around, stay awhile"
- Visitors may be looking for a particular type of artwork by the artist and should easily be able to locate this visually as they often don't have words for it
- Visitors want information about the artist's process and ideas behind each body of work, but without having to swim through a lot of text
- Visitors who are not tech savvy are able to navigate large site without frustration
- Visitors often use a phone or iPad to view the site as they are doing this in their leisure time

## Design style guidelines to follow.
*These are a list of qualities or characteristics (usually adjectives) you'd like the design to follow. The more specific you are with these the easier it will be for you to create a compelling design (e.g. don't use "Clean"). (2-3 words)*
